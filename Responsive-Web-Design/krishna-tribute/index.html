                <p>Lord Krishna, revered as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and the Supreme God in Hindu tradition, represents the perfect embodiment of divine love, wisdom, and cosmic consciousness.

                <h3>Birth and Early Life in Vrindavan</h3>
                <p>Lord Krishna was born in Mathura around 3228 BCE as the eighth son of Devaki and Vasudeva. His birth was prophesied to bring about the end of his tyrannical uncle King Kamsa's reign. To protect the divine child, Krishna was secretly transported to Vrindavan, where he was raised by his foster parents Yashoda and Nanda among the cowherd community.</p>
                <p>Krishna's childhood in Vrindavan was filled with miraculous events that revealed his divine nature. As a playful child, he performed incredible feats including lifting the Govardhan Hill to protect villagers from torrential rains sent by Indra, subduing the serpent Kaliya in the Yamuna river, and stealing butter, which earned him the endearing name 'Makhan Chor' (butter thief).</p>

                <h3>The Bhagavad Gita - Universal Teachings</h3>
                <p>Krishna's most significant contribution to spiritual philosophy came during the Kurukshetra war when he delivered the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. This sacred discourse addresses fundamental questions about duty (dharma), the nature of the soul, the paths to liberation, and the importance of selfless action. The Gita remains one of the most important spiritual texts in world literature.</p>
                
                <blockquote class="krishna-quote">
                    "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but not to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty."
                    <cite>- Bhagavad Gita 2.47</cite>

                <h3>Divine Love with Radha</h3>
                <p>The relationship between Krishna and Radha represents the highest form of divine love (prema) between the individual soul (jivatma) and the Supreme Soul (Paramatma). Their pure, spiritual love transcends physical boundaries and symbolizes the ultimate devotion and surrender to the divine. This sacred relationship has inspired countless works of art, poetry, and music throughout Indian culture.</p>
